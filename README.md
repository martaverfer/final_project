# ðŸ“š Personalized Book Recommendations with ML & GenAI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a personalized book recommendation system that combines the power of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Generative AI (GenAI)**.  Books are clustered based on user review sentiment, ratings, and genres using unsupervised learning techniques. The system then recommends books aligned with user preferences through an interactive Streamlit app. Additionally, GPT is used to generate short, natural-language summaries for each recommendation, enhancing the user experience and helping readers quickly discover books theyâ€™ll love.
